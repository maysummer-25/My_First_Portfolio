    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I hold a degree in Biochemistry from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, where I graduated in the top 5% of my class. 
      My growing interest in using technology to improve patient care led me to transition into software engineering. 
      While I'm passionate about building impactful healthcare solutions, I'm also deeply interested in education, personal productivity, and tools that enhance everyday life. 
      My goal is to create meaningful, user-centered applications that make a real difference across various fields.
