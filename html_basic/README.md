# My First Portfolio

This repository contains my first hands-on practice with basic HTML structure and webpage design as part of my ALX Frontend Development journey.

## Directory Structure

All HTML files are located in the `html_basic` directory.

---

## ðŸ“„ base_index.html

This is the most basic valid HTML file created to understand the foundation of any web document. It includes:

- A `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration
- A `head` section with a page title
- A `body` section

Validated and fixed using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

---

## ðŸ“„ index.html

This is the main homepage of the project and includes:

- Multiple paragraph tags (`<p>`)
- Headings of levels 1, 2, and 3 (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`)
- A clickable image that links to a web URL
- A link to the `tweets.html` page for users to view embedded tweets

---

## ðŸ“„ tweets.html

A fun additional page that includes:

- An embedded tweet (following Twitterâ€™s official embed guidelines)
- A link back to `index.html` for navigation

This page demonstrates embedding external content and internal linking within a small static site.

---

## ðŸ”— Navigation

- [Homepage (`index.html`)](./index.html)
- [Tweets Page (`tweets.html`)](./tweets.html)

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Writing valid HTML structure
- Using paragraph and heading tags correctly
- Embedding images and hyperlinks
- Linking internal HTML pages
- Embedding social media content (Twitter)
