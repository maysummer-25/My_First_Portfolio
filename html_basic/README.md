# HTML Basics – My First Portfolio

This project is part of my ALX Front-End journey. It contains the very first steps of learning how to structure webpages using HTML.

## Files

### `base_index.html`
A simple, valid HTML5 file that includes:
- A proper DOCTYPE declaration
- `<head>` section with a title
- `<body>` section

It was tested and validated using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

### `index.html`
A more complete HTML file that includes:
- Headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`)
- At least four paragraphs
- A clickable image that links to a website

## Directory Structure

```
My_First_Portfolio/
└── html_basic/
    ├── base_index.html
    ├── index.html
    └── README.md
```

## Why This Project?

To build a strong foundation in front-end development, it’s important to:
- Understand how HTML is structured
- Use semantic tags properly
- Build from simple pages to more complex ones
