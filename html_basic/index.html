        Brown bears are one of the largest carnivores in the world and are found across North America, Europe, and Asia. Known for their thick fur and powerful build, they are omnivores that feed on fish, berries, and small mammals. Despite their size, brown bears can run surprisingly fast and are excellent swimmers. They hibernate during winter months, conserving energy in dens dug into hillsides or beneath tree roots.
